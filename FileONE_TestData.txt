Write a function that takes a source directory path, 
a search string, and a destination filename. The 
function should then open all of the files in the given 
directory in parallel (using parallization technique of 
your choice), find lines that have the search text 
in them, and extract and output all lines with that 
search text in a file with the given destination filename. 
At the end of execution, the function should output the 
number of files it processed, the number of lines it found 
the search text in, and the number of occurrences of that search 
term (don't assume once per line).
